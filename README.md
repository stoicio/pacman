After downloading the code (search.zip), unzipping it, and changing to the directory, you should be able to play a game of Pacman by typing the following at the command line:

`python pacman.py`

Pacman lives in a shiny blue world of twisting corridors and tasty round treats. Navigating this world efficiently will be Pacman's first step in mastering his domain.

The simplest agent in `searchAgents.py` is called the GoWestAgent, which always goes West (a trivial reflex agent). This agent can occasionally win:

`python pacman.py --layout testMaze --pacman GoWestAgent`

But, things get ugly for this agent when turning is required:

`python pacman.py --layout tinyMaze --pacman GoWestAgent`

If Pacman gets stuck, you can exit the game by typing CTRL-c into your terminal.

Soon, your agent will solve not only tinyMaze, but any maze you want.

Note that pacman.py supports a number of options that can each be expressed in a long way (e.g., --layout) or a short way (e.g., -l). You can see the list of all options and their default values via:

`python pacman.py -h`

Also, all of the commands that appear in this project also appear in commands.txt, for easy copying and pasting. In UNIX/Mac OS X, you can even run all these commands in order with bash commands.txt.
